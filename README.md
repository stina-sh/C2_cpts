# C2_cpts
a minimal C2 implementation for taking the CPTS exam 

we often hear about the latest shiny new C2 framework weather it is covnant mythic or havoc and are impressed with the mind dazling amount of features they provide, 
but the reality is that this tools aren't worth the bits they'r stored on, unless the user is intimately fimiliar with source code of the tool, enough 
to debug modify improve or customize every and each line of it 

and that's why while preparing for the cpts i was faces with the coice between swallwing my pride and using a prebuilt framework or going through it only
using netcat and doing everything manually like caveman , so i decided to just write my own custom c2 from scratch 

this c2 features :

server writen in go



agent writen in C and go 

C for for tools injection using process hollowing [base address relocation]

go for uploading beaconing



needless to say this still in early stages but it serve as malluable/modular skeleton to improve upon
